# VireoxIcon

VireoxIcon is the main component for working with icons.

It already includes some default icons, but you can also add new ones by using the SVG path. The included icons can be found in the [documentation](./?path=/docs/vrxicon--docs).

To use it, import the component and use it as follows:

```js
import {VrxIcon} from 'vireoxlibrary';

<VrxIcon icon={'mail'} />
```

For API's details and configuration please read the [documentation](./?path=/docs/vrxicon--docs)
