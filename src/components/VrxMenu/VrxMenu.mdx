# VireoXmenu

VireoXmenu is a series of components that can be used to create a menu system for your web application.
It is designed to be used with the component from VireoX library, but can also be used independently.

We have created a series of components that can be used to create a menu system for your web application.

The first component is the ***VrxMenu*** component.
This component is used to create a menu container for your web application.

Inside the VrxMenu component you can add whatever you want, but we have also created a series of components that can be used to create a menu system for your web application.
In particular, we have created the ***VrxLink*** component, which is used to create a menu item for your web application.
It has two slots:
- Default slot: used to add the content of the menu item
- Child slot: used to add a submenu to the menu item

This will create a menu item with a submenu. On click, the submenu will be displayed on the right of the menu item.

Example:
```Vue
<VrxMenu>
  <VrxLink>Home</VrxLink>
  <VrxLink>About</VrxLink>
  <VrxLink>Contact</VrxLink>
</VrxMenu>
```
