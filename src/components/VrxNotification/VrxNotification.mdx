# VireoxNotification

VireoxNotification is the base component to display notifications.

The component can be used to display messages. It is possible to choose the number of maximum displayed notifications;

when the number is surpassed the notification will be placed in the overflow container.

Once there are less notifications than the maximum, a new notification from the overflow container will be displayed.

There are two ways to close the notification, either by clicking on it or waiting out the duration.

```js

<template>
    <VrxNotificationContainer ref="notification" />
</template>

<script setup>

    import {VrxNotification, VrxNotificationContainer} from 'vireoxlibrary';

    const notification = ref<IVrxNotificationUseCase | null>(null)
    notification.value.addNotification("Notification Test")

</script>
```
