# Vireox Tabbar

Vireox Tabbar is a component that allows you to create a tabbar with a set of tabs. It is a simple and easy-to-use component that can be used in any Vue3 application.

To use it, import the component and use it as follows:
```js
import {VrxTabbar, VrxTabList, VrxTabLink, VrxTabContent} from 'vireoxlibrary';

  <VrxTabbar default-value="tab1">
    <VrxTabList>
      <VrxTabLink tab_name="tab1">Tab 1</VrxTabLink>
      <VrxTabLink tab_name="tab2">Tab 2</VrxTabLink>
      <VrxTabLink tab_name="tab3">Tab 3</VrxTabLink>
    </VrxTabList>
    <VrxTabContent tab_name="tab1">Tab 1 content</VrxTabContent>
    <VrxTabContent tab_name="tab2">Tab 2 content</VrxTabContent>
    <VrxTabContent tab_name="tab3">Tab 3 content</VrxTabContent>
  </VrxTabbar>
```

The VrxTabbar component has the following subcomponents:
- VrxTabList: Container for the tab links. It has a slot for putting the tab links and whatever you want to display
- VrxTabLink: The tab link. It has a slot for putting the tab name or whatever you want to display. It has a `to` prop that should be set to the name of the tab content that should be displayed when the tab link is clicked
- VrxTabContent: The tab content. It has a slot for putting the tab content. They are automatically displayed when the corresponding tab link is clicked. It has a `name` prop that should be set to the name of the tab link that should display the content

The VrxTabbar has a mechanism to manage the active tab. You can set the default active tab by setting the `default-value` prop to the name of the tab you want to be active by default.
The component also checks if the tab links have a corresponding tab content. If not, it will print a warning in the console.
The same is true for the tab content. If a tab content does not have a corresponding tab link, it will print a warning in the console.

On tab change, the VrxTabbar emits an event with the name of the tab that was clicked.
